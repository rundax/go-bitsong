# Introduction

**BitSong** is a new music platform, which will be built using the [**Cosmos-SDK**](https://cosmos.network/) and the [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.io/) distribuited filesystem.

Our mission is to enable a simple global blockchain infrastructure that empowers the music industry.

* **Upload your music**. Upload all your productions via [**BitSong**](https://bitsong.io), your music will be saved on [**IPFS**](https://ipfs.io/) an immutable and distributed storage.
* **Blockchain Distribution**. Your music will be distributed via BitSong on all its clients. For each track listened, you will receive a real-time **BTSG** reward.
* **Immutable streams**. Thanks to blockchain technology, each stream will be recorded and impossible to modify.
* **Payments in real time**. When one of your tunes is listened to, _**you will be rewarded in real time in BTSG, and your fans will receive a portion of your profits.**_
* **Tokenize your productions**. Tokenize your productions, receive new investments for your new productions and share your rewards with all your fans.
* **Distributied Governance**. Distributed governance means that there is no element that can make decisions independently.
